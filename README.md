# VL.IO.HTTP.WebServer
Set of nodes to use run a webserver from VL.
Based on the excellent .NET library [WatsonWebserver](https://github.com/jchristn/WatsonWebserver)

Try it with vvvv, the visual live-programming environment for .NET  
Download: http://visualprogramming.net

## Using the library
In order to use this library with VL you have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org. For information on how to use nugets with VL, see [Managing Nugets](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/libraries/dependencies.html#manage-nugets) in the VL documentation. As described there you go to the commandline and then type:

    nuget install VL.IO.HTTP.WebServer -pre

Once the nuget is installed and referenced in your VL document you'll see the category "HTTP" under "IO" in the nodebrowser. 

Demos are available via the Help Browser!
